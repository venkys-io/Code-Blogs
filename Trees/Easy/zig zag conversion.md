# Zig Zag conversion

The Zig Zag Conversion is a string manipulation problem where you are given a string and an integer num Rows representing the number of rows in a zigzag pattern. The task is to convert the input string into a zigzag pattern and then read the converted string row by row.

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R

The converted string would be "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".

The Zig Zag Conversion is a string manipulation problem that involves converting a given string into a specific pattern known as the Zig Zag pattern. The Zig Zag pattern is formed by arranging characters of the string in a way that resembles the shape of a zigzag.

```python

#python program for zigzag conversion

def convert(string,numRowstring):
# Check base cases
    if numRows == 1 or numRows >= len(string):
        return string
# Initialize a list to store characters in each row of ZigZag pattern
    L = [''] * numRows
# Initialize variables for current row index and direction of movement
    index, step = 0, 1

    for x in string:
        L[index] += x
# Update direction of movement based on current row
        if index == 0:
            step = 1
        elif index == numRows -1:
            step = -1
# Update current row index
        index += step

    return ''.join(L)
    

if __name__=="__main__":
    string="PAYPALISHIRING"
    numRows=4
# Print the ZigZag conversion result
    print(convert(string,numRows))
```

## STEP-BY-STEP EXPLAINATION

1. **Function Definition:**
    
    The convert function takes two parameters: string (the input string to be converted) and num Rows (the number of rows in the Zig Zag pattern).
    
2. **Base Cases Check:**
    
    The function starts with a check for base cases. If num Rows is 1 or greater than or equal to the length of the string, the string is returned as is, as there's no need for zig zag conversion in these cases.
    
3. **Initialization:**
    
    The function initializes a list L with num Rows empty strings. This list will store the characters in each row of the Zig Zag pattern.
    
4. **Iterating Through the Characters:**
    
    The function then iterates through each character (x) in the input string.
    
5. **Placing Characters in Rows:**
    
    The character x is added to the current row (L(index)) in the Zig Zag pattern.
    
6. **Updating Direction:**
    
    The direction of movement (step) is updated based on the current position (index). If index is 0, the direction is set to 1 (moving downward). If index is equal to numRows-1 , the direction is set to -1 (moving upward).
    
7. **Updating Row Index:**
    
    The row index (index) is updated based on the direction of movement (step).
    
8. **Joining Rows:**
    
    After iterating through all characters, the rows are joined to form the final Zig Zag pattern.
    
9. **Printing Result:**
    
    In the example provided in the   main block, the input string is "PAYPALISHIRING" and the number of rows is 4. The converted Zig Zag pattern is then printed.
    
10. **Output:**

The output of the example will be the Zig Zag conversion of the input string with 4 rows.

Certainly! The provided code, with the input string "PAYPALISHIRING" and num Rows set to 4, will output the Zig Zag conversion of the string. Here's the output:

P     I     N
A   L S   I G
Y A   H R
P     I

So, the output of the Zig Zag conversion for the given input is:

    ## Time-Complexity
    
    The time complexity of the Zig Zag conversion algorithm is O(N), where N is the length of the input string.
    
    - The algorithm iterates through each character in the input string exactly once.
    - Within each iteration, operations such as appending a character to a row and updating indices are constant time.
    
    Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the input string.
    
    ## Space-Complexity
    
    The space complexity of the Zig Zag conversion algorithm is O(N), where N is the length of the input string.
    
    - The array L is created to store characters in each row of the Zig Zag pattern. The size of this array is determined by the number of rows (num Rows).
    - In the worst case, when num Rows is equal to the length of the input string, each character will be in its own row, resulting in an array of length N.
    - Additionally, the result string d is created to store the final Zig Zag pattern.
    
    Therefore, the overall space complexity is linear with respect to the length of the input string.
    
    In summary, the Zig Zag conversion algorithm has a time complexity of O(N) and a space complexity of O(N), making it an efficient solution for the given problem.

        In certain scenarios, storing data in a Zig Zag pattern may provide benefits. For instance, organizing data in a zigzag pattern can be advantageous in scenarios where quick access to specific portions of the data is required.
        
    7. **Barcode Design:**
        
        Zig Zag patterns can be used in the design of barcodes, especially in 2D barcodes. The arrangement of black and white bars in a Zig Zag manner can enhance the efficiency of barcode scanners.
        
    8. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):**
        
        OCR systems may use Zig Zag patterns when analyzing and recognizing characters in scanned documents. The pattern can help in segmenting and identifying characters more accurately.
        
    9. **Digital Signal Processing:**
    
    In certain signal processing applications, Zig Zag patterns may be employed to process or analyze data in a way that optimizes the extraction of relevant information.
    
    The Zig Zag conversion technique, while initially designed for a specific string manipulation problem, demonstrates versatility and can be adapted for various applications in different domains.
