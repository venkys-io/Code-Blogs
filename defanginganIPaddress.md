# Defanging an IP address

## Introduction:

Defanging an IP address refers to the process of modifying the standard format of an IP address to make it safe for use in contexts where raw IP addresses may be misinterpreted or misused. The term "defanging" is commonly used in the context of cybersecurity and programming to prevent accidental activation of hyperlinks or unintended actions when dealing with IP addresses.

In its typical format, an IP address consists of four sets of numbers separated by dots, such as "192.168.1.1." However, in certain situations, displaying or using the raw IP address directly can be problematic. For instance, in web development or online forums, an IP address written in its usual format can be automatically converted into a clickable link, leading to potential security concerns.

To mitigate this, defanging involves altering the IP address format to prevent automatic hyperlinking. A common method is to replace the dots with other characters, such as square brackets. For example, the IP address "192.168.1.1" would be defanged as "192[.]168[.]1[.]1."

By defanging an IP address, it becomes a plaintext representation that can be safely shared or displayed without triggering unintended actions. This practice is especially relevant in security-related discussions, documentation, or any scenario where clarity is crucial, and the risk of accidental interaction with the IP address needs to be minimized.

## Algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty string `defanged_ip` to store the defanged IP address.
2. Iterate through each character of the input IP address.
3. If the current character is a period (".")
    - Append "[.]" to the `defanged_ip` string.
4. Otherwise
    - Append the current character to the `defanged_ip` string.
5. Return the `defanged_ip` string.

## Program in `cpp`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
```

```cpp
std::string defangIPaddr(const std::string& ip) {
std::string defangedIP;
for (char c : ip) {
if (c == '.') {
defangedIP += "[.]";
} else {
defangedIP += c;
}
}
return defangedIP;
}
```

```cpp
int main() {
std::string ipAddress;
std::cout << "Enter IP address: ";
std::cin >> ipAddress;
```

```cpp
std::string defangedIP = defangIPaddr(ipAddress);

std::cout << "Defanged IP address: " << defangedIP << std::endl;

return 0;

```

```cpp
}
```

## Step-By-Step Explanation:

1. **Header Files**: Include necessary header files like **`<iostream>`** and **`<string>`**.
2. **Function `defangIPaddr`**:
    - **`const std::string &address`**: The function takes a constant reference to a string (the original IP address) as a parameter.
    - **`std::string defangedAddress`**: This variable will store the defanged IP address.
    
    Inside the function:
    
    - A **`for`** loop iterates through each character in the original address.
    - It checks if the character is a dot (**`.`**).
    - If it's a dot, it appends **`"[.]"`** to the defanged address; otherwise, it appends the character itself.
    - Finally, the defanged address is returned.
3. **`main` Function**:
    - **`std::string ipAddress = "192.168.1.1";`**: Define an example IP address.
    - **`std::string defangedIPAddress = defangIPaddr(ipAddress);`**: Call the **`defangIPaddr`** function to get the defanged IP address.
    - **`std::cout << "Original IP address: " << ipAddress << std::endl;`**: Display the original IP address.
    - **`std::cout << "Defanged IP address: " << defangedIPAddress << std::endl;`**: Display the defanged IP address.
4. Output:

```cpp
Original IP address: 192.168.1.1
Defanged IP address: 192[.]168[.]1[.]1
```

## Program in `python`:

```python
def defangIPaddr(address):
    defanged_address = ""
```

```python
    # Iterate through each character in the original address
    for char in address:
        # Check if the character is a dot
        if char == '.':
            # If it's a dot, add "[.]" to the defanged address
            defanged_address += '[.]'
        else:
            # If it's not a dot, simply add the character to the defanged address
            defanged_address += char

    # Return the defanged address
    return defanged_address

```

```python
ip_address = str(input("Enter the IP address before Defanging: "))
defanged_ip_address = defangIPaddr(ip_address)

print(f"Original IP address: {ip_address}")
print(f"Defanged IP address: {defanged_ip_address}")
```

## Step-By-Step Explanation:

1. **Function `defangIPaddr`**:
    - **`def defangIPaddr(address):`**: Define a function that takes an **`address`** parameter.
    - **`defanged_address = ""`**: Initialize an empty string to store the defanged IP address.
    
    Inside the function:
    
    - Use a **`for`** loop to iterate through each character in the original address.
    - Check if the character is a dot (**`.`**).
    - If it's a dot, append **`"[.]"`** to the defanged address; otherwise, append the character itself.
    - Finally, return the defanged address.
2. **Example Usage**:
    - **`ip_address = "192.168.1.1"`**: Define an example IP address.
    - **`defanged_ip_address = defangIPaddr(ip_address)`**: Call the **`defangIPaddr`** function to get the defanged IP address.
3. **Display the Result**:
    - **`print(f"Original IP address: {ip_address}")`**: Display the original IP address.
    - **`print(f"Defanged IP address: {defanged_ip_address}")`**: Display the defanged IP address.
4. **Output**:

```python
Original IP address: 192.168.1.1
Defanged IP address: 192[.]168[.]1[.]1
```

## Program in `java`:

```python
public class DefangIPAddress {
```

```
public static String defangIPaddr(String address) {
    StringBuilder defangedAddress = new StringBuilder();

    // Iterate through each character in the original address
    for (char c : address.toCharArray()) {
        // Check if the character is a dot
        if (c == '.') {
            // If it's a dot, add "[.]" to the defanged address
            defangedAddress.append("[.]");
        } else {
            // If it's not a dot, simply add the character to the defanged address
            defangedAddress.append(c);
        }
    }

    // Return the defanged address
    return defangedAddress.toString();
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Example usage
    String ipAddress = "192.168.1.1";
    String defangedIPAddress = defangIPaddr(ipAddress);

    // Display the result
    System.out.println("Original IP address: " + ipAddress);
    System.out.println("Defanged IP address: " + defangedIPAddress);
}

```

```python
}
```
