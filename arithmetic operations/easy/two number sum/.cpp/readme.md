# Two Number Sum Using CPP

---

# Arithmetic operations in CPP:

In C++, arithmetic operations are performed using familiar mathematical operators. Here are the basic arithmetic operations in C++:

1. **Addition (+):**
result = num1 + num2;

2. **Subtraction (-):``**
result = num1 - num2;

3. **Multiplication (*):``**
result = num1 * num2;

4. **Division (/):**
          result = num1 / num2;
Note: If num1 and num2 are integers and you want to perform integer division, use the **`/`** operator. If you want to perform floating-point division, make sure at least one of the operands is a floating-point number.
5. **Modulus (%):**
          result = num1 % num2;
The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of num1 by num2.
6. **Increment (++) and Decrement (- -):**
          num1++;   // Increment num1 by 1
          num2--;   // Decrement num2 by 1

7. **Exponentiation (not built-in):**
C++ does not have a built-in exponentiation operator like some other languages. To perform exponentiation, you can use the pow function from the <cmath> (or <math.h> in C) header.
         #include <cmath>
         result = pow(base, exponent);

## Two number sum using CPP:

### code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    double num1, num2;

    std::cout << "Enter the first number: ";
    std::cin >> num1;
    std::cout << "Enter the second number: ";
    std::cin >> num2;
    double sum = num1 + num2;
    std::cout << "The sum of " << num1 << " and " << num2 << " is: " << sum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

# Step By Step Explanation:

1. **Include Header File:**
    
    cppCopy code
    #include <iostream>
    
    this line includes the Input/Output Stream Library (iostream) for handling input and output operations.
    
2. **Declare Variables:**
    
    Declare two double-precision floating-point variables to store the numbers.
    
    cppCopy code
    double num1, num2;
    
3. **User Input:**
    
    Prompt the user to enter the first number and read the input using std::cin.
    
    cppCopy code
    std::cout << "Enter the first number: ";
    std::cin >> num1;
    
    Similarly, prompt for and read the second number.
    
    cppCopy code
    std::cout << "Enter the second number: ";
    std::cin >> num2;
    
4. **Calculate Sum:**
    
    Calculate the sum of the two numbers using the **`+`** operator and store the result in the variable sum.
    
    cppCopy code
    double sum = num1 + num2;
    
5. **Print Result:**
    
    Print the result using std::count.
    
    cppCopy code
    std::cout << "The sum of " << num1 << " and " << num2 << " is: " << sum << std::endl;
    
    # Real-World Applications of Two Number Sum Using Python:
