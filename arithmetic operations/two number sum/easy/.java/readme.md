# Arithmetic operations:

In Java, arithmetic operations are operations that involve mathematical calculations. Here are the basic arithmetic operations:

1.**Addition (+):**

           int sum = a + b;

2.**Subtraction (-):**

          int difference = a - b;

3.**Multiplication (*):**

          int product = a * b;

4.**Division (/):**

         int quotient = a / b;

Note: If a and b are integers and you want to get a floating-point result, you might want to use double or float variables.

5.**Modulus (%):**

        int remainder = a % b;

The modulus operation gives the remainder when a is divided by b.

## Two number sum using java:

### code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class TwoNumberSum{
public static void main(String[]args){
Scanner scanner =new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
    int num1 = scanner.nextInt();
    System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
    int num2 = scanner.nextInt();
    scanner.close();
    int sum = num1 + num2;
    System.out.println("The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is: " + sum);
  }
}
```

# Step By Step Explanation:

1. I**mport the Scanner Class:**

 javaCopy code
import java.util.Scanner;

Import the scanner class from the java.util package. This class is used for reading input from the console.

1. **Define the Class:**
    
     javaCopy code
    public class TwoNumberSum {
    
    Define a class named TwoNumberSum. This class will contain the main method where the execution of the program begins.
    
2. **Main Method:**
    
    javaCopy code
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    Declare the main method. In Java, the execution of a program begins in the main method.
    
3. **Create a Scanner Object:**
    
    javaCopy code
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner([System.in](http://system.in/));
    
    Create a Scanner object named scanner to read input from the console.
    
4. **Prompt for First Number:**
    
    javaCopy code
    System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
    
    Display a prompt asking the user to enter the first number.
    
5. **Read First Number:**
    
    javaCopy code
    int num1 = scanner.nextInt();
    
    Use the nextInt() method of the Scanner class to read an integer from the console and store it in the variable num1.
    
6. **Prompt for Second Number:**
    
    javaCopy code
    System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
    
    Display a prompt asking the user to enter the second number.
    
7. **Read Second Number:**
    
    javaCopy code
    int num2 = scanner.nextInt();
    
    Use the nextInt() method again to read the second integer and store it in the variable num2.
    
8. **Close the Scanner:**
    
    javaCopy code
    scanner.close();
    
    Close the Scanner object to avoid resource leaks.
    
9. **Calculate Sum:**
    
    javaCopy code
    int sum = num1 + num2;
    
    Use the addition operator (+) to calculate the sum of num1 and num2 and store the result in the variable sum.
    
10. **Print Result:**
    
    javaCopy code
    System.out.println("The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is: " + sum);
    
    Print the result, displaying the sum of the two numbers along with the original numbers.
    

When you run this program, it will interactively ask the user to input two numbers, calculate their sum, and then print the result.# Real-World Applications of Two Number Sum Using Java:

While a simple program to calculate the sum of two numbers may seem basic, the concept of adding two numbers is fundamental to a wide range of real-life applications, particularly in the field of software development. Here are some examples:

1. **Financial Calculations:**
    - In financial applications, the sum of two numbers can represent transactions, balances, or the total value of assets and liabilities. For instance, calculating the total value of a user's assets by summing up the values of their different holdings.
2. **Inventory Management:**
    - In inventory systems, the sum of two numbers might represent the total quantity of a particular product after receiving a new shipment. It's fundamental for managing stock levels.
3. **Budgeting Applications:**
    - Budgeting and expense tracking applications often involve calculating the sum of incomes and expenses to determine the overall financial health of an individual or a business.
4. **Gaming:**
    - In game development, adding two numbers is a basic operation that can be used in various scenarios. For example, it could be used to keep track of scores, calculate damage in combat scenarios, or determine the total points earned in a game.
5. **User Authentication:**
    - In some authentication systems, the sum of two numbers might be used as part of a hashing or encryption process to enhance the security of user credentials.
6. **Data Analysis:**
    - In data analysis and statistical applications, adding two numbers may be a part of aggregating data or calculating summary statistics.
7. **Telecommunications:**
    - In networking and telecommunications, the sum of two numbers might be used in calculations related to bandwidth, data transfer rates, or signal processing.
8. **Scientific Computing:**
    - In scientific simulations and calculations, adding two numbers can be a fundamental operation in various mathematical models and algorithms.
9. **Machine Learning:**
    - In machine learning, mathematical operations like addition are used extensively in the implementation of algorithms, neural networks, and optimization processes.
10. **Mobile App Development:**
    - In mobile applications, the sum of two numbers might be used in various contexts, such as calculating distances, processing user inputs, or determining display coordinates.
