# Two Number Sum Using Python

---

# Arithmetic operations in Python:

1. **Addition (+):**
          result = num1 + num2

2. **Subtraction (-):``**
          result = num1 - num2

3. **Division (/):**
          result = num1 / num2
Note: In Python 3, the division operator (/) performs true division, returning a floating-point result. If you want integer division, you can use the // operator.
          result = num1 // num2  # Integer division
4. **Multiplication (*):**
          result = num1 * num2

5. **Modulus (%):**
result = num1 % num2
The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of num1 by num2.
6. **Exponentiation (**):**
result = num1 ** num2
The exponentiation operator raises num1 to the power of num2.

## Two number sum using Python:

### code:

```python
# Take input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Print the result
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {sum_result}")
```

# Step By Step Explanation:

1. **User Input:**

           num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
           input(”Enter the First Number”)  prompts the user to enter a value, and float() converts the                    entered value to a floating-point number. The result is stored in the variable num1.
           num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
Similarly, the program prompts the user to enter the second number, converts the input to a floating-point number, and stores it in the variable num2.

1. **Calculate the Sum:**
     sum_result = num1 + num2
The sum of num1 and num2 is calculated using the + operator, and the result is stored in the variable sum_result.
2. **Print the Result:**
    print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {sum_result}")
The print() function is used to display the result. The f-string format is used to include the values of num1, num2, and sum_result in the printed message.

**Execution Flow:**

- The program starts by asking the user to input two numbers.
- It then converts these inputs to floating-point numbers using float().
- The sum of the two numbers is calculated using the + operator.
- Finally, the program prints the result, displaying the sum along with the original numbers.

# Real-World Applications of Two Number Sum Using Python:

While a simple program to calculate the sum of two numbers may seem basic, the concept of adding two numbers is fundamental to a wide range of real-world applications, particularly in the field of software development using Python. Here are some examples:
