# Quick sort
Quick sort is a popular sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It is efficient for large datasets and has an average time complexity of O(n log n).
The algorithm works by selecting a "pivot" element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The process is then repeated recursively for the sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted.
Quick sort is known for its simplicity and effectiveness, making it a commonly used sorting algorithm in various programming languages.

## Overview
Divide: The algorithm divides the array into two partitions or subarrays. This is typically done by selecting a "pivot" element from the array.

Partition: Rearrange the elements in the array such that all elements less than the pivot are on the left side, and all elements greater than the pivot are on the right side. The pivot itself is placed in its final position.

Conquer: Recursively apply the QuickSort algorithm to the subarrays on the left and right of the pivot.

Combine: The sorted subarrays are combined to produce the final sorted array.

The key to the efficiency of QuickSort lies in the partitioning step. Choosing a good pivot is crucial. Common strategies include selecting the first or last element as the pivot, or choosing a random element. The goal is to have a pivot that roughly divides the array into two equal parts.

## Code explanation
quicksort is a recursive function that takes an array arr and two indices l and r representing the left and right boundaries of the subarray to be sorted.

The function checks if l is less than r, i.e., if there is more than one element in the subarray. If there's only one element or none, the array is considered sorted, and the function returns without doing anything.

The middle index p is calculated as the floor division of the sum of l and r by 2. The element at this index (arr[p]) is chosen as the pivot.

Two pointers i and j are initialized to l and r respectively.

A while loop is used to partition the array around the pivot. The loop continues until l is not less than r.

Inside the loop, the elements at indices l and r are compared to the pivot. If arr[l] is greater than or equal to the pivot and arr[r] is less than or equal to the pivot, a swap is performed, and l and r are adjusted accordingly.

If both elements are equal to the pivot, the pivot index p is updated to either l or r.

If the elements are greater than the pivot on both sides, the right pointer r is decremented.

If the elements are less than the pivot on both sides, the left pointer l is incremented.

After the while loop, the array is partitioned into two subarrays, and the function is recursively called on both subarrays: quicksort(arr, l, p) and quicksort(arr, p + 1, j).

The if __name__ == "__main__": block initializes an array arr and calls the quicksort function to sort the array. Finally, the sorted array is printed.

Note: The provided code has a minor issue; the variable p needs to be used in the recursive calls instead of l in the first call. Replace quicksort(arr, l, p) with quicksort(arr, l, p - 1) to fix this issue.
