# Multiply String

## Introduction to Multiply String

"Multiply String" is a function that performs a specific task in programming: the multiplication of strings. This may not be a typical operation in mathematics, but in programming, it's a common task that can be used for various purposes such as creating repeated patterns, formatting output, and more.The problem typically involves multiplying two non-negative integers represented as strings and returning the result as a string. This problem is interesting because it requires implementing the multiplication operation manually, similar to how it is done on paper.

## Overview of Multiply String

The function takes two input strings. The first string is the one that needs to be repeated, and the second string is an integer in string format that indicates the number of repetitions. The output of the function is a new string which is the first input string repeated a number of times specified by the second input string. The function handles possible exceptions such as non-integer second inputs and returns an error message in such cases.

        # Iterate through each digit of the second number in reverse order
        for j in range(len(num2) - 1, -1, -1):
            y = int(num2[j])  # Get the current digit of the second number
            product = (x * y) + carry  # Calculate the product of the current digits and add carry
            carry = product // 10  # Update carry for the next iteration
            ans += str(product % 10)  # Add the last digit of the product to the result
        x= "0" * (len(num1) - i - 1)
        ans = x + ans  # Append zeros based on the position of the current digit in the first number
        if carry:
            ans += str(carry)  # If there is a carry after the inner loop, add it to the result
        res += int(ans[::-1])  # Add the current partial product to the final result

    return str(res)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = "123"
    num2 = "456"
    print(multiply(num1, num2))
```
## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. The function starts by initializing `res` and `ans` variables to 0 and an empty string respectively. `res` will eventually hold the result of the multiplication, and `ans` will be used to store intermediate results.
2. The outer loop traverses the first input string in reverse order. Each digit in `num1` will be multiplied with each digit in `num2`.
3. Inside the outer loop, `x` is set as the integer value of the current digit in `num1`.
4. The inner loop, nested inside the outer loop, also traverses the second input string in reverse order.
5. Inside the inner loop, `y` is set as the integer value of the current digit in `num2`. Then, `product` is calculated as the multiplication of `x` and `y` plus any `carry` from the previous calculation.
6. The `carry` is then updated to be the integer division of `product` by 10.
7. The remainder of `product` divided by 10 is then added to the `ans` string.
8. After the inner loop, a string `x` is created with as many zeros as the current index in `num1`.
9. This string `x` is then prepended to the `ans` string to account for place values in the multiplication.
10. If there is still a value in `carry` after the inner loop has finished, this value is added to `ans`.
11. The current `ans` string is then reversed and converted to an integer, after which it is added to `res`.
12. After all loops, the function returns `res` as a string, which is the result of the multiplication.
13. The main part of the code is where the function is called with `num1` and `num2` as arguments, and the result is printed.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. The function 'multiply' begins by determining the length of both input strings 'num1' and 'num2'. It then initializes an array 'pos' with a size equal to the sum of the lengths of 'num1' and 'num2'. This array will hold the results of the individual multiplications.
2. Two nested for-loops are used to traverse both strings from right to left (from least significant digit to most significant). The outer loop iterates through each digit in 'num1', and the inner loop iterates through each digit in 'num2'.
3. Inside the inner loop, the current digits of 'num1' and 'num2' are multiplied together to get 'mul'.
4. 'p1' and 'p2' are indices for positions in the 'pos' array. 'p1' is for the carry from the multiplication, and 'p2' is for the result of the multiplication.
5. The sum of 'mul' and the current value at 'pos[p2]' is computed and added to 'pos[p1]' and 'pos[p2]' as the carry and result of the multiplication respectively.
6. After the nested loops, the array 'pos' has computed digits of the result in reverse order. A StringBuilder is used to convert 'pos' into a string.
7. The StringBuilder 'sb' iterates through 'pos' and appends each digit to 'sb'. It skips leading zeros.
8. Finally, if 'sb' is empty (which means that 'num1' or 'num2' was zero), the function returns "0". Otherwise, it returns the string in 'sb', which is the result of the multiplication.
9. In the main part of the code, 'num1' and 'num2' are defined, the 'multiply' function is called with 'num1' and 'num2' as arguments, and the result is printed out.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

The C++ implementation of the 'multiply' function closely follows the logic of the Java implementation.

1. The function 'multiply' begins by determining the length of both input strings 'num1' and 'num2'. It then initializes an array 'pos' with a size equal to the sum of the lengths of 'num1' and 'num2'. This array will hold the results of the individual multiplications.
2. Two nested for-loops are used to traverse both strings from right to left (from least significant digit to most significant). The outer loop iterates through each digit in 'num1', and the inner loop iterates through each digit in 'num2'.
3. Inside the inner loop, the current digits of 'num1' and 'num2' are multiplied together to get 'mul'.
4. 'p1' and 'p2' are indices for positions in the 'pos' array. 'p1' is for the carry from the multiplication, and 'p2' is for the result of the multiplication.
5. The sum of 'mul' and the current value at 'pos[p2]' is computed and added to 'pos[p1]' and 'pos[p2]' as the carry and result of the multiplication respectively.
6. After the nested loops, the array 'pos' has computed digits of the result in reverse order. A string 'ans' is used to convert 'pos' into a string.
7. The string 'ans' iterates through 'pos' and appends each digit to 'ans'. It skips leading zeros.
8. Finally, if 'ans' is empty (which means that 'num1' or 'num2' was zero), the function returns "0". Otherwise, it returns the string in 'ans', which is the result of the multiplication.
9. In the main part of the code, 'num1' and 'num2' are defined, the 'multiply' function is called with 'num1' and 'num2' as arguments, and the result is printed out.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the Multiply String function is O(m*n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings. This is because the function uses two nested loops to iterate through each digit in both strings.

The space complexity of the function is also O(m+n) because an array of size m+n is used to store the results of the individual multiplications.

## Real World Applications of Multiply String

1. **In Scientific Computing:** In scientific computing, large numbers (that can't be handled by standard data types) are often represented as strings. The Multiply String function can be used to perform multiplication operations on these large numbers.
2. **In Cryptography:** In cryptography, strings are often used to represent keys and other cryptographic elements. The Multiply String function can be used in the encryption and decryption processes.
3. **In Graphics Programming:** In graphics programming, the Multiply String function can be used to create patterns or to repeat elements.
4. **In Web Development:** The Multiply String function can be used in web development to generate repeated elements in HTML or CSS, or to manipulate strings in server-side programming.
