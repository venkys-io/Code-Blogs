# Longest Common Prefix

## Exploring String Algorithms :(easy)

Today, we dive into the fascinating world of String  algorithms and uncover their most captivating mysteries — Generate Parentheses . Get ready to embark that will  challenge your minds and you will come to know about the power of string Algorithms .

## Advantages and Disadvantages :

### Advantages :

- It can help in determining the minimum number of characters needed to commonally prefix all the given strings.
- This can be useful in scenarios where strings represent words or phrases and we need to determine the shortest prefix that applies to all of them.
- It can be used to optimize searching algorithms, like in the case of Trie data structures, where the longest common prefix can significantly reduce the search space and improve search efficiency.

### Disadvantages :

- The LCP may not always lead to the optimal solution.
- It only guarantees to capture common prefixes that are shared among all strings, so it may miss patterns that are specific to a subset of the strings.
- The LCP algorithm can be slow for large strings, as it requires computing the length of the longest common subsequence to find the prefix.
- The LCP does not handle variations in string case or spacing, so the algorithm may need additional preprocessing to account for these differences.

### Overview of Longest Common Prefix :

⇒ The longest common prefix (LCP) refers to the longest string that is a prefix of a set of strings. In other words, given a collection of strings, the LCP is the longest string that is common to all of them from the beginning.

⇒ In programming and algorithms, finding the LCP is a common problem and is frequently used in various string processing tasks. It has applications in areas such as text processing, search algorithms, and more.

## Code :

### Python :

```
def longestCommonPrefix(a):
size = len(a)

# if size is 0, return empty string
if (size == 0):
	return ""

if (size == 1):
	return a[0]

# sort the array of strings
a.sort()

# find the minimum length from
# first and last string
end = min(len(a[0]), len(a[size - 1]))

# find the common prefix between
# the first and last string
i = 0
while (i < end and
	a[0][i] == a[size - 1][i]):
	i += 1

pre = a[0][0: i]
return pre
if **name** == "**main**":
input = ["geeksforgeeks", "geeks",
				"geek", "geezer"]
print("The longest Common Prefix is :" ,
			longestCommonPrefix(input))

```

## C++ :

// C++ program to find longest common prefix
// of given array of words.
#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to find the longest common prefix
string longestCommonPrefix(string ar[], int n)
{

// If size is 0, return empty string
if (n == 0)
	return "";

//If size is 1 then just return that character
if (n == 1)
return ar[0];

// Sort the given array
sort(ar, ar + n);

// Find the minimum length from
// first and last string
int en = min(ar[0].size(),
			ar[n - 1].size());

// Now the common prefix in first and
// last string is the longest common prefix
string first = ar[0], last = ar[n - 1];
int i = 0;
while (i < en && first[i] == last[i])
	i++;

string pre = first.substr(0, i);
return pre;
}
int main()
{
string ar[] = {"geeksforgeeks", "geeks",
"geek", "geezer"};
int n = sizeof(ar) / sizeof(ar[0]);
cout << "The longest common prefix is: "
<< longestCommonPrefix(ar, n);
return 0;
}

## Java :

// Java program to find longest common prefix of
// given array of words.
import java.util.*;

public class GFG
{
public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] a)
{
int size = a.length;

	/* if size is 0, return empty string */
	if (size == 0)
		return "";

	if (size == 1)
		return a[0];

	/* sort the array of strings */
	Arrays.sort(a);

	/* find the minimum length from first and last string */
	int end = Math.min(a[0].length(), a[size-1].length());

	/* find the common prefix between the first and
	last string */
	int i = 0;
	while (i < end && a[0].charAt(i) == a[size-1].charAt(i) )
		i++;

	String pre = a[0].substring(0, i);
	return pre;
}

/* Driver Function to test other function */
public static void main(String[] args)
{
	GFG gfg = new GFG();
	String[] input = {"geeksforgeeks", "geeks", "geek", "geezer"};
	System.out.println( "The longest Common Prefix is : " +
							gfg.longestCommonPrefix(input));
}

}

## Time Complexity :

The time complexity of Longest Common Prefix is O(n), where n is the number of input strings. This is because the algorithm iterates over each character in the strings and performs a constant amount of work per character.

## Space Complexity :

The space complexity of Longest Common Prefix is also O(1), as it uses a fixed-size character array to store the prefix.
